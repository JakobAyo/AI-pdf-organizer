You are analyzing an invoice dataset containing various items. Based on the following list of items, suggest {number_of_categories} distinct categories that logically group these items.

Here are the invoice data:
{all_items}

Output Format:

{{
    "Category 1": [ID, ID, ...],
    "Category 2": [ID, ID, ...],
    ...
}}

Strict Guidelines:

1. Every single invoice must be categorized - DO NOT SKIP ANY ITEMS
2. Each item must belong to exactly one category (no duplicates)
3. Categories should be broad enough to group similar items but distinct enough to avoid overlap
4. Return exactly {number_of_categories} categories
5. All categories must contain at least one item
6. The union of all category lists must include ALL invoice IDs from 0 to {max_id}
7. If an item doesn't clearly fit, place it in the most appropriate category anyway

Validation Rules:
- Count of all categorized IDs must equal {total_items}
- No gaps in ID ranges are permitted
- No duplicate IDs across categories

Example Output (for illustration):

{{
    "Electronics & Technology": [0, 1, 13, 18, 29, 47],
    "Furniture": [2, 4, 6, 7, 19, 37],
    "Office Supplies": [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 31, 42, 55],  // Note all IDs are included
    "Miscellaneous": [3, 8, 14, 15]  // No items left out
}}

Now, generate the categorized dictionary that includes EVERY invoice from the provided data.
