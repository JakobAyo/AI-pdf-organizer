You are analyzing an invoice dataset containing various items. Based on the following list of items, suggest {number_of_categories} distinct categories that logically group these items. Each item should belong to only one category. Return the results as a dictionary where the keys are the category names and the values are lists of item IDs assigned to that category.

Here is the invoice data:
{all_items}

Output Format:

[
    "Category 1": [ID, ID, ...],
    "Category 2": [ID, ID, ...],
    ...
]

Guidelines:

    Categories should be broad enough to group similar items but distinct enough to avoid overlap.

    Skip/ignore None values or invalid entries (e.g., 88: [None]).

    Ensure all valid items are assigned to exactly one category."

Example Output (for illustration):

[
    "Electronics & Technology": [0, 1, 13, 18, 29, 47],
    "Furniture": [2, 4, 6, 7, 19, 37],
    "Office Supplies": [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 31],
    "Binders & Paper Products": [15, 20, 22, 26, 39],
    "Appliances & Equipment": [21, 28, 35, 42, 55]
]

- Only return the The categories and the assigned IDs. (No Explaination needed)
- return exactly {number_of_categories} Categories
- Make sure all categories have IDs assigned to them

Now, generate the categorized dictionary for the provided invoice data.
