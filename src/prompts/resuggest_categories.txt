You are helping refine the categorization of invoice items. The user has reviewed the initial category assignments but wants to replace the following categories: {selected_categories}.

Input Data:
Items: {all_items}

Current Categories: {current_categories}

Output Format:

[
    "Category 1": [ID, ID, ...],
    "Category 2": [ID, ID, ...],
    ...
]

Guidelines:

    Replace the categories {selected_categories} with {number_of_selected_categories} new logical categories that better group their current items.

    Reassign all items to the final list of categories.

    Skip/ignore None values or invalid entries (e.g., 88: [None]).

IMPORTANT: 
- Only return the The categories and the assigned IDs. (No Explaination needed)
- Make sure all categories have IDs assigned to them.
- Don't change the other categories only reassign the IDs.
- return exactly {number_of_all_categories} categories.

Now, suggest the {number_of_selected_categories} new categories and reassign the items accordingly.
