- Only return the The categories and the assigned IDs. (No Explaination needed)
- Don't change the other categories only reassign the IDs.
- return exactly {number_of_all_categories} categories.
- Make sure all categories have IDs assigned to them.
- Distribute the items to the categories as equal as possible

Input Data:
Items: {all_items}

Current Categories: {current_categories}

Output Format:

{{
    "Category 1": [ID, ID, ...],
