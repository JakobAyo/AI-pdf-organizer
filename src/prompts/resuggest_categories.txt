You are helping to resuggest category names for invoice items. The user has reviewed the initial category assignments but wants to replace the following categories: {selected_categories}.

Guidelines:
- Replace the categories {selected_categories} with {number_of_selected_categories} new logical categories that better group their current items.
- Only return the The categories and the assigned IDs. (No Explaination needed)
- Don't change the other categories only reassign the IDs.
- return exactly {number_of_all_categories} categories.
- Make sure all categories have IDs assigned to them.
- All categories must contain at least 3-5 IDs

Validation Rules:
- No duplicate IDs across categories
- Each ID is assigned to a category

Input Data:
Items: {all_items}

Current Categories: {current_categories}

Output Format:

{{
    "Category 1": [ID, ID, ...],
    "Category 2": [ID, ID, ...],
    ...
}}

Example Output for 30 items (for illustration):

{{
    "Electronics & Technology": [22, 1, 10, 28, 17, 6, 29, 11],
    "Furniture": [7, 15, 0, 23, 12, 27, 21],
    "Office Supplies": [2, 20, 4, 24, 13, 16, 5, 9, 18],  // Note all IDs are included
    "Miscellaneous": [8, 3, 26, 14, 19, 30, 25]  // No items left out
}}

Now, suggest the {number_of_selected_categories} new categories and reassign the items accordingly.
